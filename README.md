# Spo-Fiy🎧
A mini media player that does not take up any of the screen space and allows you to quickly change music and even customize it.



What kind of features does it have?

-Ideal for quickly changing and pausing music from Spotify

-It does not take up any space on your screen. You can see the application again by pressing the "TAB" key. It will hide itself as long as you do not keep your mouse on the application window in any way.

-You can customize it however you want. You can place an image of the recommended size (340X133 corner radius=18) including the background as your background. The same applies to key assignment. You can assign any key you want.

-You can adjust the location of the application from the Settings section (only left and center positions are valid)

-You can also remove the background from the "Settings" section.

The application does not support GIF, but it may be added in upcoming updates.🫤
